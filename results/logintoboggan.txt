Please note that the behavior of LoginToboggan's Redirect path on    [1;32;40m[1m[status][0m
confirmation setting has changed in the case where users are NOT
setting their own password on registration. The previous behavior was
to automatically redirect the user to user/%uid/edit, with a final
destination of the Redirect path on confirmation setting. This
behavior has been removed. To replicate it, the path must be
explicitly declared now. Ex: to have the user visit their edit page,
with a final destination of node/foo, you would use
user/%uid/edit?destination=node/foo.
