Emilio Sosa hails from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic and was raised and educated in New York City. He realized his passion for design when he was merely 14 years old and attended Asa Philip Randolph and Art and Design High school's at the same time. He continued his art education at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York City.

<br /><br />Sosa, began his career as the assistant costume master for the Alvin Ailey  Dance company, where he travelled the world.  Upon returning to New York, he began a successful career styling music videos for ground breaking Hip Hop Artists, such as Salt and Pepa, Kid and Play and MC Lyte, to name a few.  

<br /><br />Emilio was named a National Design Virtuoso by American Theater Magazine in 2003 and received TDF/Irene Sharaff Young Master Award in 2006.  He admits that heâ€™s been inspired by historical events, which he incorporates into his design aesthetic. He certainly brings his creativity to the stage, but is now ready to take it to the catwalk.

<br /><br />A driven designer, Emilio Sosa decided to take on the challenge of a reality TV competition. He soon found himself as a contestant on the seventh season of the Project Runway, set in New York. He became known as one of the 16 designers vying for the top prize and the chance to launch their careers in the fashion industry. He won several challenges throughout the competition, leading him to take second place that season. Since the show ended, he has continued to promote esosa designs, a line he co-created with his brothers.

<br /><br />	Currently, Sosa, work can be seen in the new Broadway production of Porgy And Bess and Spike Lee's upcoming film, Red Hook Summer.
