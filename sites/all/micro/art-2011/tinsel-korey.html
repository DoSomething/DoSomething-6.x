Actress Tinsel Korey, best known for her role as Emily in the <b>TWILIGHT</b> Saga, has been promoting Arts Education since 2006-teaching acting and music while encouraging youth to use art as a way to heal and deal with the complicated issues that they face in their lives. She personally had always turned to art as a source of healing and inspiration, "It's a place to escape, and reflect on society and this world we live in. I could not live without art." she shares.
<br /><br />
Tinsel got involved in Make Art, Save Art because she believes art is fundamental for positive youth development, yet, it is the first thing that receives budget cuts. The youth that participate in this cause will not only personally be benefiting, but will also help other youth in their school benefit because the school will get a $5,000 grant for their art program as well. Tinsel adds, "That's one step in building a stronger community."
